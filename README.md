## Hi there

I'm Dan Mascarenhas, a robotics enthusiast working at Siemens Healthineers, and currently pursuing a master's degree in mobile robotics at [@lar-deeufba](https://github.com/lar-deeufba) . 

I've worked on various robotics projects, most of them using the [@husky robot](https://github.com/husky) and DJI drones like Spark, as well as some automation projects. I'm a big fan of ROS and Python. 
Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning machine learning and computer vision techniques through my master's course in mobile robotics. In the future, I'd love to work with companies or on projects that develop new robots where I can apply the know-how from the projects I've worked on.

Outside of coding, you can often find me training for triathlon competitions or repairing MRI and CT machines, which is part of my job.
Let's connect and talk tech, robots, or anything in between! 
Check out my repos to see what I've been up to.

## Current projects

Currently, I'm dividing my time among three projects, which include:

### [djiBote](https://github.com/ielson/djibote) 
An Android app that serves as a bridge between closed DJI drones (like Spark) and ROS (Robot Operating System), allowing aircraft control and sensor reading through topics. The goal is to enable more robust control for basic drones.

Current Status

- [x] Receive sensor info
- [ ] Send control info to the drone
- [ ] Receive camera data

### Master degree 
in Mobile robotics at [LaR Robotics](https://github.com/lar-deeufba)

### [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/ielson/FCCWebDesign)
fullStack developer course
