## Hi there, I'm Daniel Mascarenhas


I'm a robotics enthusiast currently working at Sonsub, part of Saipem, where I help develop and deploy advanced robotic solutions for underwater inspection with autonomous vehicles like the Flatfish AUVâ€”capable of inspecting structures down to 3000 meters deep!

</p>

I'm also pursuing a master's degree in mobile robotics at at [@lar-deeufba](https://github.com/lar-deeufba), exploring areas like trajectory planning, obstacle avoidance, reinforcement learning (SAC & PPO algorithms), using tools like ROS, Gazebo, Unity and OMPL.

Previously, I've worked on projects involving Clearpath Robotics' [@husky robot](https://github.com/husky) and DJI drones like Spark, as well as some automation projects. I'm a big fan of ROS, C++ and Python. Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning machine learning and computer vision techniques through my master's course in mobile robotics. 

When I'm not coding, you might find me training for triathlon or or exploring new places. 
Let's connect and talk tech, robots, or anything in between! 
Check out my repos to see what I've been up to.

## Current projects

Currently, I'm dividing my time among these exciting projects:

### [Underwater Robotics at Saipem](https://www.saipem.com/en/solutions-energy-transition/robotic-solution) 
Developing autonomous underwater vehicles like Flatfish for deep-sea inspection and monitoring of offshore infrastructure.

### Master's Degree in Mobile Robotics
At [LaR Robotics](https://github.com/lar-deeufba), focusing on advanced trajectory planning, reinforcement learning, and robotics simulations.
